## Bias and Variance
high bias: underfitting 
high variance: overfitting

## Solution for high bias (under fitting):
1. Try a bigger network --> can only reduce bias without increasing variance

2. Train a longing time

3*. Change a NN archetechture


## Solution for high variance (over-fitting):
1. More data --> can only reduce variance without increasing bias

2. Regularization (L2, dropout) --> can prenvent overfitting
  eg, computer vision: pixels are data, you will never have engough data, so always use dropout in **conputer vision** to **prevent over-fitting**.

3*. Change a NN archetechture

## Trade-off
1. Traditionally. reducing one will increase another one
2. But now, DL can help!
