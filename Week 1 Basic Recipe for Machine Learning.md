## Bias and Variance
high bias: underfitting 
high variance: overfitting

## Solution for high bias:
1. Try a bigger network --> can only reduce bias without increasing variance

2. Train a longing time

3*. Change a NN archetechture


## Solution for high variance:
1. More data --> can only reduce variance without increasing bias

2. Regularization

3*. Change a NN archetechture

## Trade-off
1. Traditionally. reducing one will increase another one
2. But now, DL can help!
